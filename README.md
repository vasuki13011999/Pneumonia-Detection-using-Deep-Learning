 Detection of Pneumonia Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project aimed at detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model achieves high accuracy and performance metrics, making it a useful tool for healthcare applications.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify chest X-rays into two categories: **Pneumonia** and **Normal**. By leveraging deep learning, the model can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia with greater speed and accuracy.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Framework:** Built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Dataset:** Utilizes a publicly available chest X-ray dataset of traing and test.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Test Accuracy: **87%**
  - Precision: **0.5**
  - Recall: **0.1**
  - F1 Score: **0.666**
